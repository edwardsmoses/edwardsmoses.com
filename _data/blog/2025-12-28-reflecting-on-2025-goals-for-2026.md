It's the end of the year again, and been 30 draws ever closer, I'm not sure how to feel about that. Anyways, there's no stopping it, so, as always, let's get to it, the year is winding down, let's reflect on 2025, what went well, what went terribly, and plan for 2026. If you've had read the [2024](https://edwardsmoses.com/reflecting-on-2024-goals-for-2025) version of this, you would notice the same sentence structure, pardon me, I just did a copy-paste of last year, and started editing from there :-)



Per tradition, I'll start with the most significant event of the year: traveling out of my home country, Nigeria for the first time, the perspective this afforded me has been interesting, seeing a different culture reminds me how diverse humans can be; I traveled to Qatar, and one interesting thing I learnt, was their weekends was Friday and Saturday, and Sunday the start of the work week; that was so interesting, because I would never have thought to think that other days aside from Saturday and SUnday were the weekend, makes one wonder what other culture do we take for granted, that it's not the same in other places. I'll hope to travel to more places in 2026 as well. 


## Driving 

If you've come from other years, you'd be expecting the Work section here, well, surprise; This year saw me improve my driving skills, I got to move around a lot, and that improved my driving confidence a lot, parking which had always been a challenge for me got much easier for me, still trying to perfect the parallel park though, once I got down on lock, I"ll definitely let you folks know.

## Work

Now, we move on to Work, as it was last year, full-time freelancing is still my gig, and I'm incredibly grateful for the folks I've worked with, this year was tough, with the weird esoteric bugs I've seen; it's been interesting, this year, a lot of my time went into maintaining existing projects, no new projects came around, lot of new features launched on the projects I worked on, but also making sure that existing features remained reliable as usage grew on them, whether that be adding redundancy, adding fallback mechanisms, for when things didn't work out. 

It's reminded me that great software often feels invisible when everything works well, and painfully obvious when it doesn't. 

## Learning

This year, learning has been constant, I continued my studies with UOPeople, balancing my course work alongside with my work, but it helped reinforce fundamentals that I often take for granted when working professionally.

On the technical side, I spent time deepening my understanding of systems, how things fail in practice, not just in theory. Some of this was intentional learning; a lot of it came from being forced to figure things out mid-incident.

Also, as I mentioned, last year, while I didn't get to finish reading the 'DDA' book, I did make progress on it, and also got to finish another interesting read, Software engineering at Google.

I mentioned last year, that I planned to branch out into building desktop apps, and thankfully, I managed that; (plug): meet [Clipbridge](https://github.com/edwardsmoses/clipboard_sync_mobile), it solved a problem I had faced, where I needed to copy something from my mac to my Android phone, I intend to continue working on this next year. Let's see where that takes me. 


## Health

Unfortunately, this year saw me fall back on my workout routine, I really do hope to push myself to get better at this in 2026, and keep the momentum ongoing to upcoming years. I mentioned last year, that I hoped to take on swimming lessons, and while I did, I didn't stick at it, I felt stuck at the beginner level, I hope to pick up again on this next year. 

As I promised myself last year, I finally did go through with the health checkup, and it was calming, hope to have this on the agenda for next year as well. 


## Relationships

This year, no significant effort was made to improve my relationships, I hope to get better at this next year, and be more intentional about relationship-building. 

A friend of mine, got married this year, and I had the privilege of been one of his groomsmen, and it highlighted to me how older I have grown, as this role was one I saw my 'uncles' do, when I was younger. 

Anyways, aside the reflecting, the wedding was a blast! I wish them the very best!



## Signing out

Going into 2026, I don’t have an overwhelming list of goals. I want to:
	•	Keep building reliable software
	•	Get better at managing my time and energy
	•	Continue improving my health
	•	Write a bit more consistently on this blog

Nothing revolutionary, just doubling down on what’s been working.

Here’s to hoping 2026 is kind, challenging in the right ways, and full of steady progress.

Happy New Year in advance!
