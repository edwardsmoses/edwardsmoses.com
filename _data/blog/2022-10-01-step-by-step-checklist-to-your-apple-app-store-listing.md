You've built an awesome app! You've also signed up for the [Apple Developer program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)! What's next?

In this article, I'll share a checklist of information you'll need to have your app published to the Apple App store. Let's get right to it!

## 1. App Title

The title is the most important part of your app listing. It's what your users see first and what they use to identify your app.

One thing to keep in mind though is that it can be different from your App's name on your users' device when downloaded.

I'd recommend putting the main keywords you'd expect your users to be searching for. For example, with an app, **BakeAlong**, "*BakeAlong—Your Baking Recipes*" could be the title.

It's important though to remember that you can only use up to 50 characters, so use relevant keywords!

## 2. App Description

The app description is crucial in helping describe what your app does to your users.

You can use a maximum of 4000 characters, so you'll want to present the features of your app and convince your users why they download your app.

One way to help improve your description, is by asking yourself - Who are my users? What do they want? How can my app help them? And write a convincing description for your app with those questions in mind.

## 3. Category

The app category helps Apple suggest your app to potential users. Here are [available categories](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/categories/) on the Apple app store.

## 4. Keywords

Search plays a huge role in how your users discover your app. So Apple offers you the ability to set keywords that your audience would be using to find your app.

The keywords are limited to 100 characters, separated by commas. You also can't use spaces before or after the commas, but you can use them to separate words within keywords.

For example, "Baking, Recipes, Saving Recipes" wouldn't be accepted,
but "Baking,Recipes,Saving Recipes" would be accepted.

## 5. App icon

The app icon helps your users recognize your app at a glance on the App store.

The app icon must adhere exactly to a 1024\*1024px size. Apple has a [list of best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/app-icons/) on designing your app icon.

## 6. App Pricing

Pricing for your app is organized into various tiers provided by Apple. You've have 94 tiers (87 price tiers and 7 alternate price tiers) to choose from. Find all [available pricing tiers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UAY4XeZ_fqBPJ-j4YdQF40CWjeiglGGeS5qn5-3pETo/edit?usp=sharing).

## 7. App Screenshots

Your screenshots tell the story of your app, convey your app's benefits, and convinces your users to download.

At least one screenshot is required for every device type that your application supports. Your screenshots should be available in both portrait and landscape orientation.

Here are Apple [guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/product-page/) on size and other requirements for your app's screenshots.

## 8. App Preview Video

Apple has a very [helpful guide](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-previews/) on creating a preview video for your app. You'll want to make sure that the video preview for your app concisely demonstrates the features available in your app.

## 9. Availability

The Apple review team will review your application, and you can choose to have it publicly available as soon as it is accepted by the Apple review team, or you can choose a specific launch date for when the application will be available.

Your application will be available in all countries unless you choose otherwise.

## 10. App Review contact details

When your app is submitted to the Apple review team, you'll need to provide contact details that the review team can reach you on if there's an issue with your app. This details are private and only available to the review team.

## 11. SKU Number

An anonymous number you use internally for identify your app, and used as a unique product reference ID on the sales reports.

## 12. Copyright information

Information for displaying who has copyright of the application. For example: *2022 BakingRecipes Ltd*

## 13. URLs

### 1. Marketing URL

This should be a page on your website that showcases your application and tells your users why your app is so cool.

#### 2. Support URL

A page on your website that your users can reach out to your support team.

#### 3. Privacy Policy

A page on your website for your app privacy policy. It'll be displayed on your app listing on the App store.

#### 4. EULA

You could use your own EULA or use the [default one from Apple.](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/)
