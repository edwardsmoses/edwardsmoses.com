## The Goal

When working with my clients, from day one, I want to make sure they're comfortable throughout our relationship. So, my entire process from start to finish is with that in mind!

## Requirements Gathering

To kick off, I have a meeting with the client to understand what they're trying to build. Questions like 'What is the goal of this app', 'What problem are we solving, 'What's the ideal outcome', 'Who are your users'

I want to get as much information about the client's mindset and buy into their vision of what they want the app to be.

After the meeting, I put together a proposal with the discussed requirements, estimated timelines, and budgets.

## Development

After we agree on the requirements for the app, I create a breakdown of the app tasks on Trello and send the client an invite.

I then set up a GitHub repository for the client's app if they don't have one already. And I'll get started on developing the app.

I usually work in weekly sprints - at the beginning of the week, I have a meeting with the client where I share the tasks I plan on completing at the end of the week.

During the week, daily progress updates are shared with the Client over Slack - all of my clients appreciate these daily updates as it keeps them abreast with the work I'm doing on their app.

Then, at the end of the week, we have another meeting where I demo the week's progress on the app and gather the client's feedback.

At the end of the meeting, I send over an in-progress version of the app to the client, so they can have a feel of the app, and get their impressions.

## Beta Launch

I use Firebase App Distribution for beta testing mobile applications, so I'll send invites to the client's beta users. For websites, I host the website on Firebase hosting and send over a beta URL.

During this process, feedback shared from the client's beta users is addressed.

## Launch

I help the client set up the App on the Google Play Store and the Apple App store and help them get ready to launch the app. I usually share a checklist of items that [Google Play Store](https://edwardsmoses.com/ultimate-checklist-for-successful-google-play-store-listing) and the [Apple App Store](https://edwardsmoses.com/guide-to-your-apple-store-listing/) needs, so they can get them all prepared.

And when they are ready, we publish the app and launch it LIVE!

## Post-Launch

After the app is launched, most times, from feedback from their users, the clients get new features they like to add or bugs that are only discovered when actual users start using the app.

This is one of my favorite phases of the development, as the app is in the users' hands, and we're building new features based on real users' feedback.
